<html>   </html>
<head></head>--------------->contains or store information about the page.
<title></title>

<body></body>----------->the content which is displayed on the webpagehead


ANCHOR ELEMENT----->
ANCHOR TAG------------------->WE MAKE hyperlinks


<a href =""></a>
<a href="#"><a>
<a> tag has an attribute called 'href'
(hypertext reference) which is used to
point the tag to other pages.
Guide the student to use 'href'
attribute to point it to hyperlinks.

We have two selectors which allow us
to customize the style of links.
● 'a:link' allows us to customize
the style of links.
● 'a:visited' allows us to  qsde
customize the style of visited
links

<img src= "image path"></img>
The 'src' (source) attribute is used to
give link to the image. You can add
your images of your games in the
same folder and use it in the src
attribute.
